# Screen Diagnostic Application

An online screen diagnostic tool designed to help users detect **dead spots** or **dead pixels** on their devices. This application is primarily built for **touch-screen devices** and allows users to easily identify if their screen is broken or malfunctioning.

## Features

- **Dead Spot Detection**: Test your touch screen for unresponsive areas.
- **Dead Pixel Identification**: Check for non-functional pixels across the screen.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly design for quick and easy diagnostics.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on any browser-enabled touch-screen device.
- **No Installation Required**: Fully online application, no downloads needed.

## How It Works

1. Open the application in a browser on your touch-screen device.
2. The screen will display a grid of buttons or interactive areas.
3. Touch each area to check its responsiveness.
4. If any section of the grid doesn't respond, it indicates a **dead spot** or issue with your touch functionality.
5. Observe the screen for any **dead pixels**â€”they will appear as permanently lit or unlit spots.

## Deployment

The application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for fast and reliable performance.
